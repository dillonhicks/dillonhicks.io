Format

The original artwork in vector format is provided in .AI and .EPS format (editable in Adobe Illustrator, Freehand, CorelDRAW and Inkscape). Each icon is presented on its own artboard (for more convenient export) - the artboards and paths are all named. The icons are (by default) 90px x 90px on 100px x 100px artboards (5px margins).

Also provided are individual files for each icon, in .PNG and .SVG format. The .PNG icons are 32px x 32px PNG-32s, black on a transparent background. The .SVG icons are 100px x 100px, with a black fill color.
